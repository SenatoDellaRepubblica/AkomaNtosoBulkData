				<an:p>Loan Agreement between the Bank of Italy and the International Monetary Fund</an:p>
				<an:p>
					1. 
					<an:i>Purposes and Amounts</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) To enhance the resources available on a temporary basis to the International Monetary Fund (the «Fund») for crisis prevention and resolution through bilateral borrowing, the Bank of Italy agrees to lend to the Fund an SDR-denominated amount up to the equivalent of EUR 23.48 billion, on the terms and conditions set out below.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) This agreement is based on Article VII, Section 1(i) of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, which authorizes the Fund to borrow from Fund members or other sources if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its holdings of any member's currency in the General Resources Account («GRA»). This agreement must be considered in light of the Guidelines for Borrowing by the Fund (the «Borrowing Guidelines»), which make clear that quota subscriptions are and should remain the basic source of Fund financing, and that the role of borrowing is to provide a temporary supplement to quota resources. This agreement and other bilateral borrowing agreements that the Fund has entered into or amended pursuant to the 2016 borrowing framework shall be referred to each as a «2016 Borrowing Agreement» and collectively as the «2016 Borrowing Agreements». The term «Bilateral Borrowing Agreements» shall have the meaning as defined under paragraph 4(a) of the Borrowing Guidelines.</an:p>
				<an:p>
					2. 
					<an:i>Term of the Agreement and Use</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) The term of this agreement shall end on December 31, 2019; provided that the Fund may extend the term of this agreement for one further year through December 31, 2020 by a decision of the Executive Board, taking into account the Fund's overall liquidity situation and actual and prospective borrowing requirements and with the consent of the Bank of Italy.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) The 2016 Borrowing Agreements may be activated only after the Managing Director has notified the Executive Board that the Forward Commitment Capacity of the Fund as defined in Decision No. 14906-(11/38), adopted April 20, 2011, taking into account all available uncommitted resources under the New Arrangements to Borrow (the «modified FCC»), is below SDR 100 billion (the «activation threshold»); provided, however, that the Managing Director shall not provide such notification unless (i) the New Anangements to Borrow («NAB») are activated as of the time of the notification, or there are no available uncommitted resources under the NAB as of that time, and (ii) the activation of the 2016 Borrowing Agreements has been approved by creditors representing at least 85 percent of the total credit amount committed under the 2016 Borrowing Agreements by creditors eligible to vote on such activation. For purposes of conducting a poll of eligible creditors, the Managing Director shall propose in writing the activation of the 2016 Borrowing Agreements and request the creditors'vote, A creditor shall not be eligible to vote on the activation if, at the time of the vote, its 2016 Borrowing Agreement is not effective or the relevant member is not included in the Fund's Financial Transactions Plan for transfers of its currency. Nothing in this paragraph 2(b) shall preclude the Managing Director from approaching creditors before the modified FCC is below the activation threshold, if extraordinary circumstances so warrant in order to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (c) If the 2016 Bilateral Borrowing Agreements are activated pursuant to paragraph 2(b), they shall be automatically deactivated whenever the NAB is no longer activated, unless there are no available uncommitted resources under the NAB at that time. Separately, the 2016 Bilateral Borrowing Agreements shall be deactivated if the Managing Director has notified the Executive Board that the modified FCC (excluding any amounts available under the Bilateral Borrowing Agreements) has risen above the activation threshold and: (i) the Executive Board determines that activation is no longer necessary; or (ii) six months have elapsed since the date of the Managing Director's notification and, within that period, the modified FCC (excluding any amounts available under the Bilateral Borrowing Agreements) has not fallen below the activation threshold. If, after the deactivation of the 2016 Bilateral Borrowing Agreements under this paragraph 2(c), the modified FCC were to fall below the activation threshold, the provisions of paragraph 2(b) will apply.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (d) During any period after the activation of the 2016 Borrowing Agreements as provided under paragraph 2(b) and for as long as the 2016 Borrowing Agreements remain activated in accordance with paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c), the Fund may (i) use the resources available under this agreement to fund any outright purchases made from the GRA during the term of this agreement and (ii) approve, during the term of this agreement, commitments of GRA resources under Fund arrangements whose purchases could be funded by drawings under this agreement at any time during the period of such commitments, including after the expiration of the term of this agreement and during any period in which this agreement is no longer activated in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of this agreement; provided however that the commitments covered under this clause (ii) shall also include any commitment whose approval caused the activation threshold to be reached.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (e) Following an activation specified in paragraph 2(b), the resources available under this agreement may also be used by the Fund to fund the early repayment of claims under other 2016 Borrowing Agreements if the relevant creditors under those other agreements request the early repayment of their claims in the circumstances specified in paragraph 8. Drawings may be made under this agreement to fund such early repayment of other creditors'claims for as long as claims under the 2016 Borrowing Agreements remain outstanding, including after the expiration of the term of this agreement or during any period in which this agreement is no longer activated in accordance with paragraph 2(c).</an:p>
				<an:p>        (f) Drawing under this agreement shall be made with the goal of achieving over time broadly balanced positions among creditors under all Bilateral Borrowing Agreements relative to their commitments under these agreements.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (g) Subject to paragraph 14(c), the Fund shall not make a drawing under this agreement if such drawing would result in total outstanding drawings under this agreement exceeding EUR 23,48 billion at the time of such drawing, as calculated pursuant to paragraph 10(b).</an:p>
				<an:p>
					3. 
					<an:i>Estimates, Notices, and Limits on Drawings</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) Prior to the beginning of each plan period for the use of bilateral borrowed resources, the Fund shall provide the Bank of Italy with its best estimates of the amounts that it expects it will draw under this agreement during the forthcoming period, and shall provide revised estimates during each period where this is warranted. The Bank of Italy shall not be included in the periodic plan, and no drawings shall be made under this agreement, if Italy is not included and is not being proposed by the Managing Director to be included in the list of countries in the Financial Transactions Plan for transfers of its currency. Moreover, no drawings shall be made under this agreement if the Bank of Italy was included in the periodic plan but, at the time of drawing, euro is net being used in transfers under the Financial Transactions Plan because of Italy's balance of payments and reserve position. Where Italy was not included in the Financial Transactions Plan at the time of the vote on the activation of the 2016 Borrowing Agreements and is subsequently included in the Financial Transactions Plan, drawings may be made under this agreement to fund purchases made and commitments approved during the activation period unless and for so long as the Bank of Italy notifies the Fund that it does not wish to be drawn upon for these purposes.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) The Fund shall give the Bank of Italy at least five business days'(Rome) notice of its intention to draw, and shall provide payment instructions at least two business days (Fund) prior to the value date of the transaction by a rapid authenticated means of communication (e.g., SWIFT), provided that in exceptional circumstances where it is not possible to provide at least five business days'(Rome) notice, notification of intent to draw would be made at least three business days (Rome) in advance of the value date, and the Bank of Italy would make best efforts to meet such a call.</an:p>
				<an:p>
					4. 
					<an:i>Evidence of Indebtedness</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) The outstanding drawings under this agreement will be included in the statements of Italy's position in the Fund that are published monthly by the Fund.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) At the request of the Bank of Italy, the Fund shall issue to the Bank of Italy non-negotiable instruments evidencing the Fund's indebtedness to the Bank of Italy arising under this agreement. Upon repayment of the amount of any instrument issued under this subparagraph and all accrued interest, the instrument shall be returned to the Fund for cancellation. If less than the amount of such instrument is repaid, the instrument shall be returned to the Fund and a new instrument for the remainder of the amount shall be substituted with the same maturity date as the old instrument.</an:p>
				<an:p>
					5. 
					<an:i>Maturity</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 5 and in paragraph 8, each drawing under this agreement shall have a maturity date of three months from the drawing date. The Fund may in its sole discretion elect to extend the maturity date of any drawing or of any portion thereof by additional periods of three months after the initial maturity date, which extension the Fund shall automatically be deemed to have elected with respect to the maturity dates for all drawings then outstanding unless, at least five business days (Fund) before a maturity date, the Fund notifies the Bank of Italy by a rapid authenticated means of communication (e.g., SWIFT) that the Fund does not elect to extend the maturity date of a particular drawing or portion thereof; provided however (i) that the maturity date of any drawing to fund purchases from the GRA shall not be extended to a date that is later than the tenth anniversary of the date of such drawing, and (ii) that the maturity date for any drawings to fund early repayments of other creditors'claims in accordance with paragraph 2(e), shall be a single common maturity date that is the longest remaining maximum maturity of any claim for which such early repayment has been requested or the tenth anniversary of the date of the relevant drawing to fund early repayment, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding the maturity deadlines in the preceding sentence, following an Executive Board determination that exceptional circumstances exist as a result of a shortage of Fund resources in relation to Fund obligations falling due, the Fund, with the agreement of the Bank of Italy, may extend the maximum maturity for drawings under this agreement up to an additional five years.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) The Fund shall repay the principal amount of each drawing or relevant part thereof on the maturity date applicable to that drawing or part thereof pursuant to subparagraph (a).</an:p>
				<an:p>        (c) After consultation with the Bank of Italy, the Fund may make an early repayment in part or in full of the principal amount of any drawing prior to its maturity date in accordance with subparagraph (a), provided that the Fund notifies the Bank of Italy at least five business days (Fund) before any such repayment by a rapid authenticated means of communication (e.g., SWIFT).</an:p>
				<an:p>
					        (d) Repayments of drawings shall restore 
					<an:i>pro tanto</an:i>
					 the amount that can be drawn under this agreement. The extension of the maturity of a drawing or of any part thereof pursuant to subparagraph (a) shall not reduce the amount that can be drawn under this agreement.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (e) If a maturity date for a drawing is not a business day in the place where payment is to be made, then the payment date for the principal amount of such drawing will be the next business day in that place. In such cases, interest will accrue up to the payment date.</an:p>
				<an:p>
					6. 
					<an:i>Rate of Interest</an:i>
					.
				</an:p>
				<an:p>        (a) Each drawing shall bear interest at the SDR interest rate established by the Fund pursuant to Article XX, Section 3 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement; provided however that, if the Fund pays an interest rate higher than the SDR interest rate on outstanding balances from any other borrowing on comparable terms that has been effected pursuant to Article VII, Section l (i) of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, and for as long as the payment of such higher interest rate remains in effect, the interest rate payable on drawings under this agreement shall be equivalent to the interest rate paid by the Fund on such other comparable borrowing.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (b) The amount of interest payable on each drawing shall be calculated on the basis of the outstanding amount of the drawing. Interest shall accrue daily and shall be paid promptly by the Fund after each July 31, October 31, January 31, and April 30.</an:p>
				<an:p>
					7. 
					<an:i>Denomination, Media and Modalities of Drawings and Payments</an:i>

				<an:p>        (b) Unless otherwise agreed between the Fund and the Bank of Italy, the amount of each drawing shall be paid by the Bank of Italy, on the value date specified in the Fund's notice under paragraph 3, by transfer of the SDR equivalent amount of euro to the account of the Fund at the designated depository of Italy; provided that for drawings in accordance with paragraph 2(e), the Bank of Italy shall ensure that balances drawn by the Fund that are not balances of a freely usable currency can be exchanged for a freely usable currency of its choice, and, with respect to balances drawn by the Fund that are balances of a freely usable currency, shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable such balances to be exchanged for another freely usable currency.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (c) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8, repayment of principal shall be made, as determined by the Fund, in the currency borrowed whenever feasible, in euro, in special drawing rights (provided that it does not increase Italy's holdings of special drawing rights above the limit under Article XIX, Section 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreements unless Italy agrees to accept special drawing rights above that limit in such repayment), in freely usable currencies, or, with the agreement of the Bank of Italy, in other currencies that are included in the Fund's periodic Financial Transactions Plan for transfers.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (d) Payments by the Fund of interest under this agreement shall normally be made in SDRs; provided that the Fund and the Bank of Italy may agree that interest payments will be made in euro.</an:p>
				<an:p>        (e) All payments made by the Fund in euro shall be made to an account specified by the Bank of Italy. Payments in SDRs shall be made by crediting Italy's account in the Special Drawing Rights Department. Payrnents in any other currency shall be made to an account specified by the Bank of Italy.</an:p>

				<an:p>        At the request of the Bank of Italy, the Bank of Italy shall obtain early repayment at face value of all or a portion of the drawings outstanding under this agreement, if (i) the Bank of Italy represents that Italy's balance of payments and reserve position justifies such repayment, and (ii) the Fund, having given this representation the overwhelming benefit of any doubt, determines that there is a need for the early repayment as requested by the Bank of Italy in light of Italy's balance of payments and reserve position. After consultation with the Bank of Italy, the Fund may make repayments pursuant to this paragraph 8 in SDRs or a freely usable currency as determined by the Fund or, with the agreement of the Bank of Italy, in the currencies of other members that are included in the Fund's periodic Financial Transactions Plan for transfers.</an:p>
