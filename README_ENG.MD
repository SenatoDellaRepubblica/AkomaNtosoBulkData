# Akoma Ntoso - Bulk Data - Italian Senate #

The project contains all the legislative documents of the Italian Senate in the Akoma Ntoso standard.

## Data description ##

Data are structured following the same logical organization of the Italian Senate web site (http://www.senato.it/). For every Legislature every bill has its own web page named "Scheda DDL" where it is possible to view the parliamentary steps with the related documents (presented and approved bills, reports, amendments, etc.)  

The first level of the bulk data is composed of the Legislatures. Any of them contains folders of bills in the Italian Senate. These folders contain the bills' text organized by the type of bill: proposed bill, bill debate, approved bill.

The following section contains a detailed schema of the folders structure described before.
